    <div class="Features">
      <p>Mega Wars: Experience immersive, realm-wide wars like never before. The Mega Wars system expands opportunities
        for lesser vassals to take what is rightfully theirs. Players whose lieges go to war can take sides or remain
        neutral. Rebels who fail in their aspirations can face punishments ranging from losing their titles or watching
        their dynasty vanish before their very eyes. Chaos is a ladder, its rungs wrought by the complicated system of
        alliances and sympathies to lords high and low.

        Kingsguard: As the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, your safety is paramount. Recruit the most elite knights in
        Westeros to join your Kingsguard. The Knights of the Kingsguard serve for life, protecting the King’s family and
        leading his armies in war.

        Expanded Councilors: The Hand of the King, or the Castellan for lesser lords, is one of the most powerful
        councillors at your disposal. Assigning them to a variety of tasks based on their aptitude across all
        lifestyles. When Ruling the Iron Throne, if your Lords Paramount are not competent enough for the complexities
        of the Small Council, you may borrow their vassals to serve the realm dutifully instead.

        Knights and Squires: As a ruler, you have the option to offer budding young men, and exceptional women, a chance
        to squire for you with the chances of becoming a knight. Along the way, you'll experience plenty of
        opportunities to train your squire and track their progress.

        The Night’s Watch & Beyond the Wall: Take the Black as the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, with the goal of
        antagonizing the wildling kingdoms far beyond the shadow of the Wall. As a Wildling, participate in the Struggle
        Beyond the Wall, uniting the fracturous free folk by sword or song.

        Deeper Roleplay: For custom characters, there are new opportunities to blend seamlessly into the world of Ice
        and Fire. Use the House Customizer to join an existing House or revive a long-dead dynasty, or forge your
        backstory with the help your maester, who will preserve your glorious history for generations to come.

        Armors, Crowns, and Swords: Included are armors for each of the Seven Kingdoms, as well as many new ancestral
        valyrian steel swords and so many crowns for every conceivable kingdom.

        More Cultures & Religions: 8,000 years of history have resulted in 40 distinct, playable cultures in Westeros,
        each with unique traditions and Men-at-Arms suited to their homelands. Each religion, from the Faith of the
        Seven to the Cold Gods, brings new unique doctrines and holy sites for you to worship as your desire.

        Spy Networks: Build a network of little birds throughout the realm, spying on rival lords, collecting their
        secrets at a pace worthy of the excessive subterfuge in Westeros.

        An Enormous Map: Experience Westeros in a size never before seen. The continent contains over 6,100 baronies,
        with over 1,000 playable counties. In future releases, this will expand to include the Free Cities, Valyria, the
        Great Dothraki Sea, and beyond.

        A Meticulously Detailed Map: From the Frozen Shore to the Red Mountains of Dorne, our map portrays Westeros as
        if it were an extension of the real world. Each kingdoms’ capital has its own custom model, as well as most of
        the major cities on the continent and some minor castles. Our focus on canonical and ecological accuracy will
        fulfil all of your map-staring needs.

        Roads, Roads, Roads: Guide your doomstacks along roads that are more than eye-candy- with two different tiers
        imparting higher supply limits and movement speeds to facilitate the most dangerous of doomstacks.

        And so much more… This list is not complete- there’s so much new stuff, from game-changing mechanics to the
        smaller details. You’ll just have to play to see the rest of what is included!</p>
